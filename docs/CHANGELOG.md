## 2026-05-12 — Remove database, switch to browser-only state

**Motivation:** App is deployed to Vercel where SQLite cannot run (no writable filesystem). Use case is anonymous multi-user enterprise tool with no cross-session persistence requirement — DB is unnecessary.

**Changes:**
- Deleted `prisma/`, `src/generated/prisma/`, `src/lib/db.ts`, `prisma.config.ts`, `dev.db`
- Deleted `app/api/projects/` routes (POST/GET/PATCH for project records)
- Removed deps: `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/adapter-libsql`, `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `@libsql/client`, `pg`, `@types/pg`, `prisma`
- Added `src/lib/storage.ts` — `localStorage`-backed replacement (`listProjects`, `getProject`, `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `downloadProject`, `importProjectFromJson`)
- Added Import/Export buttons in `PersistentHeader` (Step 1, Step 2) and on the home page
- Updated consumer files to use storage helpers instead of fetch:
  - `app/page.tsx` (now client component)
  - `app/projects/[id]/step1/page.tsx`
  - `app/projects/[id]/step2/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/PersistentHeader.tsx`
  - `src/components/step1/ApplicationForm.tsx`
- `/api/vehicles` retained — it reads bundled JSON files, works fine on Vercel
- Persistence between sessions/devices is now user-driven: Export → JSON file → re-Import

**User-visible behavior:**
- Projects persist within a single browser as long as `localStorage` is intact
- To share or back up a project, user clicks Export → downloads a `.json` file
- To resume on another device (or after clearing browser data), user clicks Import → picks the `.json` file
- No accounts, no sign-in, no shared server state — every user's data stays in their own browser
